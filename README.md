@Pepelius here!

I'm on a path to learn and master everything about React & NextJS. I'm a huge video game enthusiast, which probably shows as an influence on most of my projects. Apart from developing my skillset further, I am constantly honing my skills in the "vanilla web development" area as well, so it is common to see me start off with a vanilla JS repository and later recreating that same project in a more modern stack.

Currently working as a full-time Web Developer with 8 years of on-field experience.

My skillset and self-proclaimed skill levels are the following...
  - HTML5 & CSS3 (Professional)
  - JavaScript (Intermediate)
  - React (Novice)
  - SQL (Novice)
  - Git (Novice)
  - NextJS (Beginner)

Want to have a chat or team up on a project? Hit me up and let's discuss the details - I'm usually very eager to participate, given that I don't have any other time consuming projects going on.
